# rock-paper-scissor
Here's a small rock-paper-scissor game I made

user chooses an option, the computer randomly selects a move, we get a result.

Also, the score is updated after every turn and it's saved inside the localStorage so even when you refresh the page, the score will still be there untill you press the reset button.
